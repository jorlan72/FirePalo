# FirePalo
FirePalo helps you convert rules and objects from Cisco FirePower to Palo Alto

Run "show access-control-config" from the FTD device and save output to a textfile.
Open the textfile in FirePalo.exe and it will create editable objects.

Finally, "commit" the changes and create a configuration in SET format that can be pasted into a Palo Alto device or Panorama.
